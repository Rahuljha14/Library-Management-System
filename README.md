# Library-Management-System
A c++ project using OPPS.


         ###INTRODUCTION###
•	This Library Management System project is for monitoring and controlling the transactions in a library. 
•	It mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new members, new books, and updating new information, searching books and members and provides facility to borrow and return books. 
•	We can enter the record of new books and retrieve the details of books available in the library. 
•	We can issue the books to the students and maintain their records. 
•	Late fine is charged for students who return the issued books after the due date. 
•	Only one book is issued to students at a time.
•	New Book is not issued to students who have not returned the last book.



      ###OBJECTIVE###
	The objective of the project is to computerise the functions of the Library. 
	Computerisation helps in better record keeping and management of the Library. 
	This simplifies the work of the Librarian as he/she is able to keep a better check on which book is issued by which student. 
	Newly arrived books can easily be added, and data about any book can easily be modified with the help of this project.
	Also, records can be transferred from one system to the other without any loss of information.
